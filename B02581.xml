            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of great Numbers of <hi>SILK-VVEAVERS,</hi> as well <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who are Makers of <hi>Luteſtrings</hi> and <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modes Silks</hi> in <hi>Spittle-fields,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>England,</hi> in relation to a Clauſe Offered by the <hi>Luteſtring Company,</hi> to be Incerted in the Cole Act, Concerning the Sealing the ſaid Silks.</head>
            <p n="1">I. FIrſt, they are very ſenſible that there is conſiderable Quantities of <hi>French</hi> Luteſtrings, and Alamodes Imported into <hi>England,</hi> to the Prejudice of the ſaid Manufactury here, and are ready to Join with the Luteſtring Company in Petitioning the Honourable Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to prevent the ſame for the future, being equally prejudiced by the ſaid Importation with the Luteſtring Company.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But it ſeems by the Clauſe, That the Intent of the ſaid Luteſtring Company is not only to prevent Importation of <hi>French</hi> Luteſtring, and Alamode, but to prevent all other Weavers (but what works to them) to make the ſaid Silks, contrary to a Clauſe inſerted in their Patent upon the Petition of the Weavers, that nothing therein contained ſhould be conſtrued to Obſtruct or Hinder the Weavers from making the ſame; or to that Effect.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Clauſe offered by the ſaid Patentees is, That all Alamodes, and Luteſtrings ſhall be Seiz'd, and a Fine of 100 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> on thoſe in whoſe Cuſtody they are found that are not Seal'd at the Cuſtom-houſe, or by their Company.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. They know that they will Seal none at the Cuſtom-houſe, but what are Imported from beyond Seas, or ſeiz'd and condemned by Law, and the Luteſtring Company will Seal none, nor indeed can but what they make themſelves, and what is not Sealed is to be Forfeited, ſo that here will be all the Weavers in <hi>England</hi> that make the ſaid Silks, and are not of that Company (which are and would be a far greater Number than thoſe imployed by the Luteſtring Company) if they were not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in their Lawful Callings; and if not Relieved by the Honourable Houſe, may be the Ruin of their Wives, Children and Families.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The ſaid Luteſtring Company will then oblige the ſaid Perſons to work to them at their own Prices, or to leave off working on the ſaid Silks, and by that means diſcourage the Growth of the Manufacture; and by Monopolizing to themſelves the Sole Dealing, and will ſet what Price they pleaſe on the ſaid Silks in prejudice of all the Subjects of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. Therefore, It is moſt humbly prayed, That there may ſome Proviſion be made, that may paſs with the ſaid Clauſe to appoint where thoſe Lutoſtrings and Alamodes ſhall be Sealed that are made in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> by Weavers that work for themſelves, and not for the Luteſtring Company; And that the ſame Penalty may be laid upon thoſe (that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Appointed) ſhall refuſe to Seal their Silks, as there is to be on them that do not Seal them at all.</p>
